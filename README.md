# getmETHere

getmETHere was a project me and 4 other students from ETh developed for the [VIScon](https://viscon.vis.ethz.ch/) 2021 over the span of 42 hours. Because of the time limit the code is ugly, but at least it works ;)

The application allows student to find the nearest facility they are searching for (out of a list of different services like printers and bathrooms, for example) at ETH. Due to the time limit, again, we managed to allow an user to find only facilities on the same floor as the user himself.

It also implements an admin console where facilities and/or floors/rooms can easily be added or made unavailable and a report system to signal problems with one of said services.
